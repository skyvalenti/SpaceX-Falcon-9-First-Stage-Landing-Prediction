# Project Overview

Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, is a trailblazing American company specializing in spacecraft manufacturing, launch services, and satellite communications. Headquartered at SpaceX Starbase in Brownsville, TX, the company aims to reduce space transportation costs through reusable technology and ultimately establish a sustainable colony on Mars. SpaceX is renowned for its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, as well as the Dragon spacecraft.

In this capstone project, we aim to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX’s cost efficiency, with launches priced at $62 million compared to other providers’ $165 million, is largely due to their reusable first stage. By predicting landing success, we can estimate launch costs, offering valuable insights for companies bidding against SpaceX.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Convert a JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it shareable using GitHub.
- Utilize data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
- Load, clean, and analyze datasets to uncover interesting insights.
- Apply data science skills in a practical setting as a Data Scientist for a private space launch company.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from various sources.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Improve data quality through cleaning and preprocessing.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the processed data to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **SQL Practice**: Query the data to gather further insights.
5. **Statistical Analysis and Visualization**: Apply basic statistical analysis and visualize relationships between variables.
6. **Data Grouping**: Split the data into groups based on categorical variables for deeper analysis.
7. **Model Development**: Build, evaluate, and refine predictive models.
8. **Presentation**: Create a comprehensive presentation to communicate your findings and analysis.

## Capstone Project Details

This capstone project is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. It offers a unique opportunity to engage in real-world data science tasks, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, model development, evaluation, and reporting.

As a senior-level participant, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX. Your task is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage, enabling your company to make informed bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.
